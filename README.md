# web-scraping
Python app to retrieve data from websites.

I used the website http://webscraperio.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/ to retrive data and insert them into a excel spreadsheet using the pandas library. 

I used the BeautifulSoup library to scrap the data. The library is friendly and easy to use for some lightweight web scraping.
